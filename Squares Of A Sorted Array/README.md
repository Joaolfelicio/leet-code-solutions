### TODO: 

Instead of sorting the array, create another solution where you create a second array and using two pointers where you fill the second array.

"For example, with [-3, -2, -1, 4, 5, 6], we have the negative part [-3, -2, -1] with squares [9, 4, 1], and the positive part [4, 5, 6] with squares [16, 25, 36]. Our strategy is to iterate over the negative part in reverse, and the positive part in the forward direction."
